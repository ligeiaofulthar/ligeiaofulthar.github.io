## Instructions

In this project, I implement a navigation that dynamically updates itself, if new code is added. The current section in viewport gets highlighted. If a navigation link is clicked, it scrolls to the corresponding section. The selected nav-item is going to be highlighted.

To look at my project, open `index.html`
