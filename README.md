## Instructions

In this project, I implement a navigation that dynamically updates itself, if headlines are added. The current section in viewport gets highlighted, as well as the corresponding link. If a navigation link is clicked, it scrolls to the corresponding section.

To look at my project, open `index.html`

If you find bugs, write me an email office@yulia.graphics
